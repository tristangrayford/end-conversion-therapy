As you have outlined, I believe it is important that we engage with religious leaders on the impact of certain teachings on their LGBT members.  It is crucial that we also establish a public complaints mechanism for reports of conversion therapy and ensure there is support for survivors as well as awareness training for both the healthcare sector and religious organisations.

Aside from the social impact of an ideology that views LGBT+ people as inferior, the evidence clearly shows that efforts to change sexual orientation or gender identity are ineffective and damaging to mental health. Practitioners of conversion 'therapy' often claim that what they really promote is freedom of lifestyle choice. However, this is a complete red herring. A ban on conversion 'therapy' in no way restricts the lifestyle choices of LGBT+ people. If an LGBT+ person wishes to live a lifestyle that differs from the majority of the LGBT+ community, whether for religious reasons or any other reason, that is their choice, no matter how the rest of us may feel about their choices. Nobody is saying that we have the right to control how people respond to their own identity, however we do have the right to ban pseudoscience where there is clear evidence of harm. Promotion of a false choice does not increase freedom of choice. So-called reparative therapy for sexual orientation, particularly the version targeted at gay men, has thankfully been losing public credibility in recent years, though of course a full and comprehensive ban on the practice is still needed. But I am particularly concerned by the increasing publicity given to a narrative promoted by anti-transgender groups that gender incongruence can be a 'social contagion', despite the clear evidence that gender identity forms at an early age and that it is just as immutable as sexual orientation. As a cisgender member of the LGBT+ community I recognise that anti-trans rhetoric is often just a recycling of old homophobic tropes, and we must fight for a world in which transphobia is no less unacceptable than homophobia. None of us are free until all of us are free."},

But to put people through a process which pressures them, sometimes using their faith and personal relationships, to deny who they are, is a psychological torture that we should all stand against. If you only stand for principles when they affect you, you don’t you really have principles, just interests. It's important this election because I’ll be honest, my first reaction when asked about this issue was to be incredulous that these sorts of practices still exist. Then, I was horrified to find out that Scotland has several centres promoting these programmes, including at least one right here in Edinburgh. I’m also appalled by the lack of honesty in claims that asking for celibacy or similar denial is fundamentally different from conversion. To say, “we’re not telling you to not to BE gay or trans, we’re just telling you not to live your life as if you are gay or trans”, is to ask someone to live their life in denial of person they are. You can’t tell me that’s not only wrong, but dangerous and damaging. The practice should be banned outright."},

SNP MPs will press the UK government to reform laws and regulations, which are reserved to Westminster, to ban and prevent the practice of conversion therapy. It is important to recognise that such therapy is without any evidential basis, unsurprisingly, given that most of the research findings indicate an adverse impact on people’s mental health, rather than a ‘cure.’ The SNP Government does not support or advocate the practice of conversion therapy anywhere in the UK, and fully support moves to ban it. Some of my SNP MP colleagues participated in the recent Westminster Hall debate on the e-petition 300976 relating to LGBT conversion therapies, pressing the UK Government to ban the practice. My colleague and Women and Equalities Spokesperson Kirsten Oswald MP said during the debate: “Let us be clear: LGBT people do not need their identities debated nor do they need to be converted. That is fundamental. Nobody’s identity should be subject to debate or to change by other people.” I trust that you find this response reassuring that I and my SNP colleagues share your concerns about this abominable practice."},

People advertising that they can change people from being gay to heterosexual, are at the very least, guilty of misinformation and are likely to cause a great deal of human misery. While, as far as I know, there is no legislation being proposed around this issue, or even how such legislation might be framed. However, I will be aware of the valid points you make about this issue - which I am very sympathetic to - should it come before the next parliament. "},
