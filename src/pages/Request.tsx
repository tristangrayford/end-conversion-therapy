        This following definition sets out measures we are calling on Holyrood
        candidates to support that would establish criminal offences and support
        for victims of conversion therapy.
      </p>
      <h2>What is Conversion Therapy?</h2>Conversion therapy aims to change or
      suppress an individual’s sexual orientation, to repress or reduce their
      sexual attraction or behaviours, or to change an individual’s gender
      identity to match the sex they were assigned at birth.
      <br /> <br />
      Conversion therapy, the forced conditioning against a person’s sexuality
      or gender identity, has damaged generations of LGBT+ young people and
      adults and continues to do so. Almost two-thirds of respondants to a
      survey on the practice had suffered from mental health issues as a result
      of experiencing conversion therapy, and nearly a third said they had
      sought counselling to help them recover from it. Mental health issues
      caused by experiences of Conversion Therapy include many experiencing
      self-harm, eating disorders, and attempted suicide.{" "}

      from across the UK.<h2>What are we calling for?</h2>We are calling for
      action by the Scottish Government to br/ing an end to the abusive practice
      of conversion therapy in Scotland. The experiences of those who were put
      through this practice show a significant public health case for banning
      conversion therapy and the need for a criminal ban. These areas fall
      within the devolved powers of the Scottish Government and should be
      legislated for by the Scottish Parliament. <br /> <br />
      Legislation should be introduced to ban: <br />
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>causing a person to undergo conversion therapy</li>
        <li>
          removing a minor from Scotland to undergo conversion therapy abr/oad
        </li>
        <li>providing conversion therapy</li>
        <li>advertising an offer to provide conversion therapy</li>
      </ul>{" "}
      <br />
      This must be supplemented by further measures, including: <br />
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          establishing a public complaints mechanism for reports of conversion
          therapy
        </li>
        <li>ensuring support for survivors, including access to counselling</li>
        <li>
          safeguarding and awareness training for public and private healthcare
          and support sector
        </li>
        <li>safeguarding and awareness training for religious organisations</li>
        <li>
          engagement with religious leaders on the impact of certain teachings
          on their LGBT members
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Request</h2>
      <p>
        We ask that all candidates for the Scottish Parliament in the 2021
        election pledge to support legislation br/inging an end to Conversion
        Therapy.
