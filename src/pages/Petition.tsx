        <strong>
          End Conversion Therapy Scotland welcomes Holyrood Committee report
          into a ban on Conversion Practices
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Scotland’s major LGBT+ groups and the End Conversion Therapy Campaign
        have welcomed a report from the Scottish Parliament’s equalities
        committee which recommends new legislation to ban conversion practices
        in Scotland. “The Committee agrees that conversion practices are
        abhorrent and are not acceptable in Scotland. They should be
        banned.”&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        The Equalities, Human Rights and Civil Justice Committee has today
        published its report on the <em>“End Conversion Therapy” </em>petition
        introduced by End Conversion Therapy Scotland<em>.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Summarising the evidence, the Committee today recommends that new
        legislation is br/ought forward “promptly” to comprehensively ban the
        practice in all its forms. End Conversion Therapy Scotland have called
        this “a welcome and vital step towards ending the abuse and torture of
        LGBTQ+ people in Scotland”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Survivors of conversion practices and a number of leading LGBT+
        organisations - LGBT Youth Scotland, Stonewall Scotland, Equality
        Network and Scottish Trans - were among those invited to give evidence
        and have also welcomed the Committee’s recommendations for swift
        action.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>Dr Rebecca Crowther, Policy Coordinator at Equality Network says:</p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          <em>
            “We are delighted to see the recommendations made by the Committee
            and look forward to the next stages, ensuring that these harmful
            practices are finally put to an end across Scotland. It is thanks to
            the testimony of survivors of these abhorrent practices that the
            Committee has made these recommendations - We want to thank them for
            standing up and sharing their stories so that these practices could
            finally be stopped.”&nbsp;

        Megan Snedden, Policy and Campaigns Manager at Stonewall Scotland
        says:&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          <em>
            “A fully comprehensive ban on conversion practices is necessary to
            protect LGBTQ+ communities in Scotland from harm. That’s why we
            welcome that the Committee’s report makes clear that a ban must
            cover sexual orientation and gender identity, both adults and
            children, all settings, and with no exceptions for so-called
            ‘consensual’ practices. We’ll continue to work with MSPs and the
            Scottish Government to ensure that Scotland delivers a comprehensive
            ban on conversion practices in the most effective manner and without
            delay.”

      </p>
      <p>
        “Conversion therapy” is the misleading name for practices and directive
        behaviour intended to change or suppress someone’s sexual orientation or
        gender identity. Conversion practices are based on the misconception
        that these can be changed and on phobic beliefs that being LGBT+ is
        wrong or in need of being ‘fixed.’ There is nothing therapeutic about
        them. The Committee heard from a number of survivors of conversion
        practices that had taken place in Scotland.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        When giving evidence before the Committee, Blair Anderson of End
        Conversion Therapy Scotland who is a gay man who was put through
        conversion practices as a child, said:&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          <em>
            “Conversion ‘therapy’ is not a positive, therapeutic or beneficial
            treatment. It is often seen as a form of torture. The International
            Rehabilitation for Torture Victims said that conversion ‘therapy’
            violates the global ban on torture. People cannot consent to
            torture. It is not possible to change your sexuality or your gender
            identity. Conversion ‘therapy’ cannot work. We consider conversion
            practices to be a form of torture and it does not work.”

        Stonewall Scotland, Equality Network, Scottish Trans Alliance, and LGBT
        Youth Scotland
      </h3>
      <h4>
        Submission to the Scottish Parliament Public Petitions Committee of 23
        September 2020
      </h4>
      <p>
        Stonewall Scotland, Equality Network, Scottish Trans Alliance, and LGBT
        Youth Scotland support the principles of petition PE1817 to “urge the
        Scottish Government to ban the provision or promotion of LGBT+
        conversion therapy in Scotland.” This submission sets out our proposals
        for ending the harmful practice of sexual orientation and gender
        identity conversion therapy in Scotland, and commitments we would like
        to see from the Scottish Government.
      </p>
      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>
        In June 2020, the UN Independent Expert on protection against violence
        and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity
        called for a global ban on conversion therapy, stating: “practices of
        ‘conversion therapy’, based on the incorrect and harmful notion that
        sexual and gender diversity are disorders to be corrected, are
        discriminatory in nature… actions to subject lesbians, gay, bisexual,
        trans or gender-diverse persons to practices of ‘conversion therapy’ are
        by their very nature degrading, inhuman and cruel and create a
        significant risk of torture.” At a domestic level, NHS Scotland, in
        addition to a range of national bodies such as the br/itish
        Psychological Society and the Royal College of General Practitioners,
        signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Conversion Therapy
        (2017), which committed to ending the practice of conversion therapy in
        the UK. It states that conversion therapy, whether in relation to sexual
        orientation or gender identity, is unethical and potentially harmful.
        The MoU commits these organisations to making the risks of conversion
        therapy known to professionals and the public, and to ensuring that new
        and existing psychological therapists are appropriately trained to avoid
        these harmful practices1 . Our Calls We understand from the Scottish
        Government’s correspondence to the Committee2 that it “fully supports
        moves by the UK Government to end conversion therapy” and that officials
        “are engaging with the UK Government as they develop proposals.” As this
        is an area of policy which may touch both devolved and reserved
        responsibilities, we encourage the Scottish Government to continue
        working with the UK Government to ensure any proposals developed by the
        UK Government would be effective. However, we would request that the
        Public Petitions Committee call on the Scottish Government to commit to
        the following: • Take measures, within its devolved competence, to end
        conversion therapy in Scotland, if the UK Government does not make
        timely progress on ending (including banning) conversion therapy across
        the UK. • Take measures, within its devolved competence, to ‘top up’ any
        measures introduced by the UK Government to end conversion therapy, if
        these measures would be insufficient in effectively rooting out
        conversion therapy in all its forms.
      </p>
      <h4>Our Proposals</h4>
      <h4>Legislative Ban</h4>
      <p>
        Legislation should ban conversion therapy practices that take place in
        both the public and private sphere, including those performed by
        healthcare professionals and within faith communities. According to the
        UK Government’s National LGBT Survey, most instances of conversion
        therapy in the UK (19 per cent and 51 per cent respectively) occur in
        these settings3 . A far-reaching ban is therefore necessary for
        legislation to be effective. There should be no restrictions on who is
        protected by the ban. Children and adults, deemed vulnerable or not,
        must be protected, including those who ‘consented’. A legislative ban
        should also include an equal level of protection for those who have been
        subject to conversion therapy based on sexual orientation or gender
        identity. This is particularly important given the finding of the
        National LGBT Survey that trans people were more likely to be offered or
        subjected to conversion therapies. Any intervention should begin from
        the understanding that conversion therapy is not neutral and is targeted
        at stopping LGBT people from being themselves. Supportive and affirming
        therapies that allow young people to explore and better understand their
        sexuality and gender identity should not be affected4. In line with
        recommendations by the UN, a ban must also include a prohibition on
        advertising the practice, establish a system of sanctions for
        non-compliance and a strong complaints mechanism5 . These measures are
        essential to ensure the efficient implementation of a legislative ban.
      </p>
      <h4>Non-Legislative Measures</h4>
      <p>
        It is vital that a specific legislative ban on sexual orientation and
        gender identity conversion therapy is accompanied by a wider package of
        work to root out these damaging practices in all their forms, seeking to
        end the practice in addition to banning it, and support survivors. These
        measures will also mitigate the risk that criminalising the practice
        might drive conversion therapy underground6 . The UN Independent Expert
        made recommendations for educational campaigns that tackle stigma around
        the LGBT community, fostering an open dialogue with health professionals
        and religious groups to raise awareness around the harms of conversion
        therapy, and training for practitioners7 . In addition to focusing on
        prevention, work around conversion therapy should seek to support
        survivors of conversion therapy, such as establishing a helpline,
        counselling service, and developing compensation initiatives.
